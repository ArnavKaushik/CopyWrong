# CopyWrong
## Inspiration
Youtube has had many copyright issues with content creators, often resulting in original owners losing credit for their work. This is to help them avoid any unfortunate events such as demonitization. We looked at other copyright programs, such as Turnitin.
## What it does
The app determines if two videos are similar and if they have the potential to be taken down on youtube or any other platform for content creators.
## How we built it
We used Swift and MacOS to analyze videos and present a score.
## Challenges we ran into
Our algorithms are not at the level we want them to be, and we plan on working on making them more accurate.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our efficiency is swift (no pun intended), but our accuracy is not. We are proud that our app's UI is nearly complete, with only images left to put in.
## What we learned
Copyright algorithms are quite intricate as there are layers towards frame by frame analysis.
## What's next for CopyWrong
We are making a better method of searching for similarities and potentially using Machine Learning to recognize objects and present a frame by frame similarity report.
